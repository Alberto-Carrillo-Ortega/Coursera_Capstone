# Coursera Applied Data Science Capstone

## Introduction
 Repository for Applied Data Science Capstone in IBM Data Science Professional Certificate in which we will study the nature of the relationship between Toronto's neighborhoods crime rates and the different venues and business that relate to them. 

The Capstone consist of 5 weeks in which different problems are tackled.

---
## Week 1
This week is about the creation of a repository and the upload of a notebook. A simple task.

---
## Week 3
In this week the goal is to cluster the neighborhoods of Toronto by their borough information.
To do so some web scraping and data wrangling is necessary. 

After that we can proceed with the analysis.

## Week 4
From here on out is the core of this capstone. Using *Foursquare API* and external data sources we have to come up with a Data Science project and develop it.

I choose to study the relationship between the different establishment in a neighborhood and their impact in that zone crime. Because I belive that intersectionality is very important to gain insights about the world and move forward improving it.

For this week we had to write a report about the idea we wanted to study and the data sources we were gona use. In addition to the mandatory *Foursquare API*, I choose to use a data set from Toronto's Open Data Portal.

## Week 5
In the last week of the Capstone we have to complete the previous report,
A notebook with the work of the project, and a presentation.

For my report i choose the following structure:

* Introduction

* Data Acquisition and Preparation

  * Data Sources

  * Data Cleaning

  * Data Preparation and Feature Selection

* Preliminary Analysis

* Predictive Modeling

  * Preprocessing

  * A Regression Approach

  * A Classification Approach

* Conclusions

* Bibliography

The Notebook uses a similar structure.
